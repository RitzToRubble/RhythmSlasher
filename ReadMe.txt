Rythm Slasher - K00215438

My rythm slasher game was based on the idea of playing drums instead of slashing blocks. 
I thought this would give a new feel to the standard rythm slasher type of game.
As ambitous as my idea was, i was not able to fully complete my game due to a 
problem occuring with the controllers that even with help from the lecturer i was not able to solve.
I take full responsibility for this problem and will try harder in our next assignment.
I did accomplish part of my start goals with notes rising from the floor and the user
having a window of opportunity to strike them before they disappear. Other than this, I dont think 
I did as well as I am fully capable of doing. I had planned on creating the start menu and end screen 
over the christmas break but Unity has had problems running on my pc at home, aswell as NetBeans.
I would not consider this assignment a success and will work harder in the future.




Other: Over the christmas break i realised i have not been putting in as much work and effort as i should
be, so I will be focusing more and working harder for the next AR assignment and the practical exam in hopes of improving my 
overall work.
